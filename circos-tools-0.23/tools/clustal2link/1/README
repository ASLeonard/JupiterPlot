One of the Circos tools is clustal2link, which parses clustal alignments and generates Circos input files to draw the alignments and coverage.

You'll find this tool in the Circos installation directory under 

# tools/clustal2link

Let's quickly run it on the data and see what the image looks like.

# > ./run.sh
# > cd circos
# > circos
