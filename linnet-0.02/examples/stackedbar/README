Hive plots are excellent at communicating cumulative data, such as
would be shown in a stacked bar plot or steam graph. 

A stacked bar plot is transformed into its hive plot equivalent by
replacing the edges of adjacent bar stacks with an axis. In this way,
the two sides of a bar component are no longer dependent. When they
are allowe to vary, you can communicate a change in quantity, or a
ratio.

The stacked bar representation is fundamentally the same hive plot as you've seen for a graph, except now the "node" is replaced by the y-value of the bar and the "edge" is drawn as a ribbon to make up the bar.

The circular composition makes it easy to compare adjacent bar plots.

Run ./run to generate some sample images in img/.


DETAILS

Much like for .dot files, the ../../bin/linnet image drawer does not know how to deal with stacked bar plots directly. These must be first parsed and turned into a data format that linnet understands.

This parsing is done by bin/stackedbar. The input stacked bar plot files are expected to be a matrix with columns corresponding to each bar plot and rows to each bar. For example, three stacked bar plots with 4 bars each may look like this

  2 3 1
  4 8 5
  1 3 5
  4 2 2

bin/stackedbar affects the output image by one or more of the following

 -dual  interprets two columns as data on a single axes
 -cumul interprets data to be cumulative, which is drawn as a stack
 -norm  normalizes the data either by its max or sum

For other parameters, see the man page

  bin/stackedbar -man
