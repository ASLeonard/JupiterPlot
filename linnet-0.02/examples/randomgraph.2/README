This example expands on ../randomgraph.1 by drawing several different
hive plots for the same graph.

Small (100 nodes), medium (500 nodes), large (1000 nodes) and huge
(2500 nodes) graph dot files are available in ./dot. Each is available
in sparse (0.5 edge density), medium (1.5 edge density) and dense (5.0
edge density). The number of edges is density*nodes.

The graphs were created by

./dot/makerandgraph

which, as in the ../randomgraph.1 example, calls 

../network/bin/makedot

to create random graphs.

Specify which dot file you wish to parse by editing the 'g' variable in

./run

and execute the script, which will first attempt to make a hairball
(if you have neato, part of the graphviz package) and then create 9
different hive plots based on parsedot and linnet configurations
N=1..9

./etc/parsedot.N.conf
./etc/linnet.N.conf

Recall that the job of parsedot is to read the .dot file, create
node-to-axis assignments and node placements and generate the segment
and link files for linnet.

To learn about each of the hive plots, consult ./etc/README and look at the example image panel ./img/panel.png


THINGS TO TRY

Change the sampling of the graphs from gaussian to uniform in ./dot/makerandgraph

Try creating a very large graph (10,000+ nodes)
