RANDOM GRAPHS

In this example, a .dot file for a random graph is created using

./makegraphs

The .dot files are parsed parsed and hive plots are created using

./makehiveplots

The output is placed in

./img

The hive plot configuration file used for these plots is in

./etc


DETAILS

The 'makegraphs' script calls

../network/bin/makedot 

which creates .dot files of the random graphs. You can generate graphs
of any size and connectivity, and choose how nodes are selected for
edges (uniform or gaussian).

Take a look at the man page for 'makedot' to learn about how to
control the random graph structure.

../network/bin/makedot -man

The two .dot files in this directory

graph.gaussian.dot - gaussian edge sampling
graph.uniform.dot  - uniform edge sampling

vary only by how nodes are sampled for edge creation.

For a graph with N nodes, in uniform sampling a node has a 1/N
probability of participating in an edge. In gaussian sampling, the
probability is normal with mean N/2 and default standard deviation
N/8.

In both .dot files, the graph has
 
  - 1000 nodes
  - 2000 edges
  - fully connected (each node has at least one edge)
  - directed

The 'makehiveplots' script calls 

../network/bin/parsedot

which is responsible for parsing the .dot file into a segment and link
file that is understood by linnet. During this step, nodes are
assigned to and placed on axes. The configuration file

etc/parsedot.conf

controls how this is done.

Once the .dot file is parsed (segment and link files are created in data/), 

../../bin/linnet 

is called and uses

etc/linnet.conf

configuration file to draw the hive plot. 


THINGS TO TRY

By commenting out node_index_position in etc/parsedot.conf, nodes are
placed on axes based on absolute connectivity, not rank ordered.

By commenting out scale_norm in etc/linnet.conf in some/all <axis>
blocks, the axis length is not normalized and becomes proportional to
(a) number of nodes, if rank ordered position is used or (b) maximum
connectivity of a node group.

Take a look at the format of the segment and link files in the data/ directory.
