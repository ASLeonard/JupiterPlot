The files here are the output of bin/parsedot, which converts a graph
.dot file into files that ../../bin/linnet can understand.

segments.txt - size and color of individual segments; segments are
assigned to axes in configuration file for linnet (etc/linnet.N.conf,
for this example set)

links.txt - links between nodes on segments; positions correspond to
nodes mapped onto segments
