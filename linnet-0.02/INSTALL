This software requires perl to run. If you're on a *NIX machine (any
Linux, SunOS, Solaris, Mac OS X) you probably have perl installed
already. 

You may need to install a few modules.


INSTALLING PERL

Check if you have perl. 

> which perl
/usr/bin/perl

If you see this, you have perl. 

> which perl
>

If you see no output, you don't (or it's not in your PATH, which it should be).

I won't go into the details of installing perl - there are too many
ways to do it. Chances are a package (bundle, or whatever your
operating system calls precompiled distributions) is available. Check at www.perl.org.

If you are running Windows, your options are either Strawberry Perl or
ActiveState Perl. Both are linked to from www.perl.org.

Installing perl should be relatively painless.


INSTALLING MODULES

Perl comes with a large number of workhorse modules. In addition, a
few other modules are required to run the software. All these modules
are available from CPAN (www.cpan.org), the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network.

Which modules do you need? Run ./list.modules to get the list. The
list below may not necessarily be the most updated one - run
list.modules to be sure.

> ./list.modules
Carp
Config::General
Cwd
Data::Dumper
File::Basename
FindBin
GD
GD::Image
GD::Polygon
Getopt::Long
Graph
Graph::Layout::Aesthetic
Graph::Reader::Dot
Graph::Writer::Dot
GraphViz
IO::File
List::MoreUtils
List::Util
Math::Bezier
Math::Random
Math::Round
Math::VecStat
Pod::Usage
Readonly
Set::IntSpan
Statistics::Descriptive
Storable
Time::HiRes

To test which modules you have, and which are missing, 

> ./test.modules
Carp ok
Config::General ok
Cwd ok
Data::Dumper ok
File::Basename ok
FindBin ok
...

If you are missing any of the modules, an obvious error will be produced.

If you attempt to run any script components that require a module you do not have, the error message looks like this

You need to install the Missing::Module module for this program to run. See http://search.cpan.org/...

(if I've added the error check to the code) or like this

Can't locate Missing/Module.pm in @INC (@INC contains:
/home/martink/perl/5.10.0/lib/5.10.0/x86_64-linux
/home/martink/perl/5.10.0/lib/5.10.0
/home/martink/perl/5.10.0/lib/site_perl/5.10.0/x86_64-linux
/home/martink/perl/5.10.0/lib/site_perl/5.10.0 .).
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted.

Either way, these errors tell you Missing::Module is ... missing. Note that the module name uses :: to encode the directory of the module file. For example, if an error indicates that Set/IntSpan.pm is missing, the corresponding module name is Set::IntSpan.

To install it, use the perl CPAN shell

> perl -MCPAN -e shell
...
cpan[1]> install Missing::Module
...
... lengthy output here, should end with a message like
...
... /usr/bin/make install  -- OK
...
cpan[2]> exit
>

If you attempt to install a module you already have an up-to-date version for CPAN will duly inform you.

cpan[1]> install Already::Installed::Module
Already::Installed::Module is up to date (1.00)


INSTALLING GD

Except for GD, installing the modules should cause you no problems. 

GD, on the other hand, can be tricky, since it depends on your
system's C libgd library, among others. Getting all the dependency
ducks in a row ranges across the full scale of pain, from "wow that
was fast" to "omg omg we're all going to die".

Many problems can arise when compiling perl's GD module. Any problem
you encounter has likely been solved by others, so here's where a good
Google will help.

You should compile GD with TrueType font (TTF) support (requires freetype
library) as well as PNG support. It's a good idea to also include
JPEG, although this software does not use that output format.

If you are not seeing any text in your output images, but expect to,
this is invariably due to lack of TTF support in your GD
compilation. You'll need to reinstall the module, making sure that TTF
support is activated.
